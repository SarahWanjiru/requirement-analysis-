# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the principles of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of figuring out exactly what a piece of software needs to do before anyone starts building it. Think of it like creating a detailed blueprint before constructing a house — you need to know how many rooms, where the doors go, and what the homeowner actually wants before you start laying bricks.

In software development, this means sitting down with the people who will use the software (customers, employees, users) and asking: *What problem are you trying to solve? What features do you need? What should it look like?* All of these answers get carefully written down and organized so that the development team knows exactly what to build.

**Why does this matter?** Building software is expensive and time-consuming. If the team builds the wrong thing — or misses important features — it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Requirement Analysis helps prevent those mistakes by making sure everyone understands and agrees on what's being built from the very beginning.
